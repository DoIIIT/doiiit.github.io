description: "<p>Critical Making: Body Politics</p>
<p>Exploring Identity, Expression, and Corporeality through the creative process</p>

<p>Join us Monday to Tuesday, October 17-18, 2016 with special guest Leah Buechley, former MIT Media Lab professor and creator of Lilypad Arduino, for an hands-on interactive workshop on creating expressive wearables.</p>

<p>You may have seen the Porcupine Dress, heard of the world’s first “eyeborg”, or be a fan of Viktoria Modesta’s fusion of fashion, music, and prosthetics.</p>

<p>Ever wondered how to create something like that? Do you have your own story to tell through design and making?</p>

<p>In this workshop students of all levels - bachelors, masters, and PhD - will learn about and discuss critical making from a variety of perspectives, join a team of 2 -3 others to design and prototype their own wearable, and have an opportunity to hear Leah's personal journey. Workshop sessions include an overview of critical making, wearable technology tutorial, issues related to body politics, and a make-a-thon. The event culminates in a panel discussion with Leah and invited guests, followed by presentations of prototypes and discussion.</p>
