<p>The Data of Watercolor: Creating & Analyzing Watercolor Art to Support Generative Art Creation</p>

<p> DoIIIT is excited to announce a series of generative art experiments workshops during the upcoming week & Winter semester 2019. In this series of workshops entitled: \"The Data of Watercolor: Creating & Analyzing Watercolor Art to Support Generative Art Creation\", we invite a group of students and faculty who are passionate about redesigning processes of traditional art with digital tools and platforms. Creative outcomes of these workshops will be exhibited in the DOIIIT exhibition area, located on the 4th floor of the North Quad.</p>

<p>The first workshop will start next Thursday (12.6) from 12-3pm. In this event, we will introduce the project objective/resource, and watercolor making techniques. Participants will get hands-on experience in making watercolor paint from pigment and binders. </p>

<p>Program Objectives</p>
<ul>
  <li> Build a connection between pigments, watercolor forms, and digital creations 
  <li> Creating, collecting, and digitizing original watercolor art 
  <li> Exploring possibilities of applying data science methods in generative art (i.e. if you treat colors/art pieces as datasets, what would you want to get from the dataset?) 
  <li> Create physical art pieces for DoIIIT's exhibition area + digital interactive pieces for the display area 
</ul>

<p> Future Workshops in 2019 </p>
<ul>
<li> Generative art in javascript/python
<li> Introduce generative art resources
<li> Tutorial for basic image processing in python 
<li> Discussion for physical + digital creations  
<li> Paint making +  painting section
</ul>

<p>Sponsored by Rackham Interdisciplinary Workshop</p>
