<p>Prototypes, Ethnics, and Time: Where did my Arduino go?</p>

<p>During this workshop, we invite participants to think, design and build open source hardware prototypes and products in consideration of their time cycles - its movement across geological, social and economic timelines. These timelines help us understand how technological artifacts transform over time in consideration of market fluctuations and trends, environmental concerns and constraints as well as sociopolitical shifts and policy changes.</p>

<p> The goal of the workshop is to explore the different timelines typical to different models of product development and hardware production. We add to conversations around agile and \"rapid prototyping\" and traditional corporate design timelines a more global and holistic consideration of time and making, drawing inspiration from China's shanzhai (山寨) culture. 

<p> With shanzhai as a critical element that enabled the growth of open source hardware, we will examine technology life cycles (production, use, discard, recycle) in the context of their impact of labor, environment, and social change. We consider where prototypes we have made and/or products we possess go, from its initial production, replication, distribution and use, asking questions like \"How can I make the first 100 units of my first prototypes?\" and \"What is this made of and where does it come from?\" </p>
