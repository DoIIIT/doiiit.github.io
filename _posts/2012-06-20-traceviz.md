##Abstract

The popularization of Location Based Services (LBS) has
created new challenges for MobileHCIion designers in
validating the design of their applications. Existing tools
designed to play back GPS location traces data streams
have shown potential for testing LBS applications and for
supporting rapid and reflective prototyping. However,
selecting a useful set of location traces from among a large
collection remains a difficult task. In this project we present
TraceViz, the first system that is aimed specifically at
supporting LBS designers in exploring, filtering, and
selecting location traces. TraceViz employs dynamic
queries and “brushing” to allow LBS designers to flexibly
adjust their trajectory filter criteria to find location traces of
interest. An evaluation performed with eight LBS designers
and developers indicates that TraceViz is helpful for rapidly
locating useful traces and also highlights areas for future
improvement
