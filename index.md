As computing technologies have becoming more ubiquitous and accessible, our interaction with information, people and technology has profoundly changed. The emerging makerspaces and Fablabs all over the world, and the call for studying everyday computing have confirmed such change and need to explore how people can better create and interact with various technologies situated in our environment, from displays to prosthetics to robots to “enchanted” objects. We believe creating a place that supports exploration and investigation of new interactive products and services that will be beneficial to our existing HCI research and support diverse research directions in the future.
