# Interaction Ecologies group website

This site is built using Jekyll.
Everything is a post, but some posts only have metadata.
Managed by Gaurav at the moment.

### To update your details and project info:
- Send me the information you would like to put up on the site 

####OR Do it yourself:

- Inside the posts directory, you will see individual userâ€™s posts.
- edit them to update the site directly
- Also, in the posts directory are posts for projects, e.g. stonesoup.
- you can copy its content to create similar posts for your projects
- Naming convention is the date when the person was added to the group and the name. So my post is "2011-08-20-gaurav.md"
	- The project posts are named similarly. 


### Site Management 
1. When content is required from a person, I will create and assign and issue on Github and assign it to that individual. That person can either update the site directly, or email me the required stuff.
2. I will send weekly emails to the group highlighting which issues are unresolved.
3. Create issues that might need the input of the whole group. Like design stuff. Feel free to give suggestions or directly make changes after some discussion.
4. If input is needed soon, I will personally email the person.

### To run on your local server for testing

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:InteractionEcologies/interactionecologies.github.io.git
```

2. Install jekyll by doing
```
gem install jekyll
```

3. Go to the project directory and do:
```bash
jekyll serve
```

in the main directory. It will start a webserver on your machine on port 4000.
